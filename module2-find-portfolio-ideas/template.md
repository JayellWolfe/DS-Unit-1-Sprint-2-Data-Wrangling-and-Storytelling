## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
very possibly yes

2. Trend related to the news
while there are likely many news stories that cover something related to my topic, i dont feel this is relates to my topic directly

3. Who does that?
yes, this would be a template I could use for my topic

4. Answering a question people care about
yes, i believe that people do/would care about my topic

5. Valuable to businesses
I am sure that data from my topic could be useful to many companies looking to make products that would help. So yes, I could use 
this template for my topic

6. What's the most popular?
I do not feel this would be useful for me to use

7. Cost/Money rankings
No this would not be useful for my topic

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
~that ALL elderly need/require help 
~that ALL disabled need/require help 


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
I found Ed Chin's example to be the most inspiring. It was clear and to the point, the graphics were well done and provided clear 
examples 

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
I am fairly certain that I could yes.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
yes I could

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
Yes I could

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
I have been searching in Alzheimer's websites, and a few other websites through my google searches to try and find a dataset that 
would be useable for my topic(s)

# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.

The one i would like to focus on would be if the elderly have a higher quality of life/live longer if they have live in support rather 
than an occasional visting nurse(if they even have that).
